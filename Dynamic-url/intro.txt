1> req.query

    base_url?naam=gautam&age=24

    -> anything after '?' is a key value pair that is attached to req.query object. This is universal property of http get requests
       and not specific to any framework.





* dynamic binding is done using ':'

How req.params Works

* All the frameworks need this functionality and have their own way of doing it, req.params is specific to express.
When you define a route in Express, you can create dynamic placeholders in the URL path by using a colon (:) before the parameter name. These placeholders allow you to capture values directly from the URL.

For example:

    /user/:id
    /product/:productId

like if it is  xyz/:id 
-> xyz is base url, and after that their will be random thing, which we are giving name as "id", it can be anything.
-> how it works is, that for any url , express attaches a "params" property, with value emepty object, and whatever u take as dynamic route like 
   "id" in this case is attached to that object. And this is not limited to first dynamic path only, BUT u can put as many dynamic path, and all
    will be attached to req.params WITHOUT NESTING.

    eg:-   base-url/:first_id/:second_id

    so, req.parms = {
        first_id : _value_,
        second_id : _value_
    }

    In this way we can access all the parameters easily.

    * suppose we were not using req.params, then we can't use get method bcz of security reason. Hence we needed to
      use post request, which  we used in case of req.params also. BUT we got a good trick here to directly wrap the button
      inside form and make button type submit , so we can directly send request to api, without creating extra function to 
      send api request.
