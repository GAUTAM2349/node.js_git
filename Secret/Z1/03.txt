* Read-Eval-Print Loop, which is an interactive programming environment that allows you to write and execute code in real time.
  It is often used to test snippets of code or experiment with a programming language.
    How REPL Works:

    Read: The REPL reads the code you input.
    Eval: It evaluates (executes) the code.
    Print: It prints the result of the evaluation.
    Loop: It then loops back, allowing you to input more code.


* value of this in different environments is different, and people used to use this in global conext to get global object of
    each environment. In web workers, self refers to window object, and due to so many things, to avoid confusions,
    'globalThis' keyword was made, which in every environment refers to global object of that environment.

* In node.js 'global' is the global object. It has setTimeout ( which was feature of browser and not v8 in browsers )    , microtaskQueue,
  ,etc... properties which is addition to v8 in node.js. Their is many more thing unique to node.js. we will se later.
