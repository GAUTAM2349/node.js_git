* Inside mongodb, we have different databases. Thes databases have different collections (similar to table in rdbms).
  Like records for each row in table in rdbms, here each row( just to understand ) or new inserted data is call 
  DOCUMENT. These documents are in Bson( binary json ) format. Each property is called field ( column in rdbms ).

* In rdbms, their is fixed schema for a table, and if a column is defined in schema then all the rows or records will
  have that column, but this is not case in mongodb. Documents of same collections can have different fields.

*  While MongoDB allows documents with different structures, using Mongoose schemas ensures that your documents
   have a consistent shape and follow certain rules.
































Index: An optional data structure that speeds up data retrieval.
Replica Set: A set of MongoDB servers providing data redundancy and high availability.
Sharding: Distribution of data across multiple servers for horizontal scalability.
Aggregation: A feature that allows complex data processing, including filtering, grouping, and transformations.
